                                        This project presents the design and implementation of an interactive game system based on the
                                        8051 microcontroller. Central to the system is a 16x32-resolution dot matrix display, constructed from eight
                                        individual 8x8 dot matrix units to form a 16x32 pixel display area. This display serves as the
                                        primary interface for the game, showcasing dynamic visual elements and game interactions.
                                        <p>
                                        The system incorporates a PS2 controller with a custom-designed
                                        hardware interface. which uses shiftresgisters to store the data and Interrupt unit which send interrupt when reading of 33bits are completed by hardware then the PS2 hardware sends data through IO expander and This interface leverages the interrupt capabilities of the 8051 microcontroller, ensuring
                                        real-time responsiveness and input recognition. The interface efficiently handles data latching
                                        from the controller, translating player actions into on-screen movements seamlessly.

                                        The scoring mechanism, made through the use of shift
                                        registers. These registers drive an LED-based scoreboard, providing players with a
                                        visual feedback of their performance in the game.
                                        <p>
                                        The game logic, developed in assembly language, includes algorithms for paddle
                                        movement and ball dynamics. It ensures that the gameplay is adhering to the
                                        physical constraints of the dot matrix display. Collision detection algorithms are implemented to facilitate
                                        interactions between the ball and paddles, also I have added some dynamicity to the game by adding faster ball movement after some amount of time to make game challanging.
                                        <p>

                                    <p class="mb-2"><p>In this project, an IoT platform was developed comprising a website for server-side rendering utilizing the Django framework and an ESP32/ESP8266 for client-side rendering. Additionally, this cloud API and an app  for communication with the server and an ESP32 was created in the python, Additionally I developed an library to enable communication between all aforementioned components. </p>

                                    <p>In this project, I have developed a Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem using Django and the Django REST framework. This ecosystem is designed to be integrated with ESP32 microcontrollers, leveraging a custom library written in C++ for communication and data handling.</p>

                                    <p><b>Custom ESP32 Library in C++:</b> The core of the system's hardware interaction lies in the custom C++ library developed for the ESP32. This library is engineered to efficiently manage data communication between the ESP32 and the server. It makes use of the EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) to intelligently filter and eliminate redundant data received from the server. Furthermore, it is programmed to send data back to the server only when necessary, optimizing network traffic and system performance.</p>

                                    <p><b>HTTPS and WebSocket Communication:</b> The IoT ecosystem utilizes HTTPS for secure data transmission, ensuring that all communication between the ESP32 devices and the server is encrypted and safe from potential intrusions. Additionally, WebSocket technology is employed for real-time data exchange, enhancing the responsiveness and interactivity of the system.</p>

                                    <p><b>Customizable Data Handling:</b> One of the key features of this ecosystem is its flexibility in data handling. Users have the capability to customize the type of data sent from the ESP32, ranging from digital and analog signals to GPS coordinates. This versatility allows the system to be adapted for various use cases, including location tracking which can be visually represented on maps.</p>

                                    <p><b>Django Backend with REST API:</b> At the backend, Django serves as the robust framework supporting the system, with the Django REST framework facilitating API interactions. These APIs are crucial for receiving data from the ESP32 devices and sending commands or information back to them.</p>

                                    <p><b>Asynchronous HTTPS Requests on ESP32:</b> To minimize latency in API communication, the ESP32 library is designed to handle HTTPS requests asynchronously. This approach reduces the delay in sending and receiving API requests, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the system.</p>

                                    <p><b>Dynamic ESP32 Management:</b> The system provides features for dynamically adding or removing ESP32 instances. This functionality is crucial for scaling the system and managing multiple devices simultaneously.</p>

                                    <p><b>WebSocket Data Transmission:</b> In addition to HTTPS, the ecosystem also supports data transmission through WebSockets. This feature is particularly useful for scenarios where continuous and real-time data streaming is required, such as in sensor monitoring applications.</p>

                                    <p>This IoT ecosystem, developed from scratch, exemplifies a sophisticated blend of software and hardware integration. By combining the power of Django with custom C++ programming for the ESP32, the system offers a versatile and secure platform for various IoT applications. Its ability to handle different data types, including real-time location tracking, along with efficient communication protocols like HTTPS and WebSockets, makes it a robust solution for modern IoT challenges.</p>

                                        <p>The technical stack employed in the realization of this project included Django, PostgreSQL, Django-Rest-Framework, ESP32, C++ and React.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-2">In this ambitious project, I developed a custom bare-metal RTOS tailored for the STM32F0711 board, which is based on the ARM Cortex M0+ architecture. This RTOS was uniquely implemented in three distinct scheduling methodologies: Round Robin, Cooperative, and Periodic Scheduler. Each of these implementations caters to different operational requirements, demonstrating the versatility of the system.

                                        Round Robin Scheduling: In this mode, the RTOS allocates a fixed time slice to each task, rotating through them in a cyclic order. This approach ensures fair CPU time distribution among all tasks, suitable for systems where tasks have similar priority levels.
                                        
                                        Cooperative Scheduling: Under cooperative scheduling, tasks voluntarily yield control back to the scheduler, allowing other tasks to execute. This method provides more control to the individual tasks over their execution but requires well-designed task interaction to prevent issues like task starvation.
                                        
                                        Periodic Scheduler: The periodic scheduler is designed for tasks that need to run at regular intervals. This implementation is particularly useful for time-sensitive tasks that require consistent and predictable execution timing.
                                        
                                        Mutex Implementation: To manage access to shared resources, I have incorporated mutexes in the RTOS. These mutexes are essential for avoiding race conditions and ensuring data integrity when multiple tasks access the same resource.
                                        
                                        SysTick Handler for Task Switching: The core of the task management mechanism in this RTOS is the SysTick handler. This handler is responsible for task switching, leveraging the SysTick timer of the STM32F0711 board to trigger context switches at precise intervals.
                                        
                                        Context Switching with ARM Assembly: One of the critical aspects of this RTOS is the efficient handling of context switching. This process involves saving the current state of a task and restoring the state of the next task to be executed. To accomplish this, I used ARM assembly to manipulate the stack and registers, ensuring that each task’s context is preserved and restored accurately. This approach is crucial for maintaining the integrity of task execution and allowing seamless switches between tasks.
                                        
                                        Stack Management for Tasks: Alongside context switching, the RTOS also manages the stack space for each task. This management is vital to prevent stack overflows and to ensure that each task has sufficient stack memory for its execution.
                                        
                                        This RTOS project highlights the complexities of low-level programming and system design on ARM Cortex M0+ architecture. It demonstrates a deep understanding of real-time concepts and the intricacies of task scheduling, context switching, and resource management. The implementation of different scheduling algorithms along with mutexes makes this RTOS a robust and flexible solution for various real-time applications.</p>

                                        Circular Buffer: Also developed in C, the circular buffer efficiently handles data in a fixed-size storage, cycling through it without the need for shifting elements.
                                        UART Driver Development:
                                        
                                        Created a driver for Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) communication. This driver forms the foundation for serial communication in the embedded system.
                                        Using the UART driver, I developed a command processor for controlling an LED. This setup demonstrates the practical application of UART in device control.
                                        PWM Drivers and Timers:
                                        
                                        Developed Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) drivers, crucial for controlling the duration of an electrical pulse, commonly used in various control applications.
                                        Implemented timers to provide accurate time delays and event counting, essential for numerous embedded system functions.
                                        DMA and DAC Integration:
                                        
                                        Integrated a Direct Memory Access (DMA) bare-metal driver, facilitating efficient data transfers without burdening the CPU.
                                        Developed a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) driver, capable of generating square, sine, and triangle waves. This functionality was further enhanced by reading the output using an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) driver.
                                        Code Optimization:
                                        
                                        Conducted optimization of existing C code to enhance execution speed. Initially, the code execution time was 400 milliseconds, which was significantly reduced to 82 milliseconds after optimization.
                                        The performance improvement was partly achieved by integrating assembly language, demonstrating the effectiveness of low-level programming in optimization.
                                        OLED Display Driver Development:

                                    <p class="mb-2"> This project involved developing a comprehensive system for generating and distributing event passes, primarily designed to streamline the process for large-scale events like university fests. The system's functionality and technical implementation are as follows:

                                        Event Pass Generation:
                                        
                                        The system automatically generates personalized event passes based on the provided user data. This process includes creating a unique identifier for each attendee, which is crucial for managing large crowds and ensuring event security.
                                        QR Code Integration:
                                        
                                        A complex model for QR codes has been integrated into each pass. This feature is especially useful for handling high volumes of attendees, as it allows for quick and efficient verification at entry points. The QR codes contain encrypted data about the attendee, enhancing the security and efficiency of the check-in process.
                                        Custom Pass Design and Upload:
                                        
                                        Users have the flexibility to upload custom designs for their passes. This feature adds a personalized touch to the event experience and caters to the specific branding or thematic needs of different events.
                                        Email Distribution:
                                        
                                        Once the passes are generated, the system automatically sends them to attendees via email. This electronic distribution method is not only environmentally friendly but also ensures that attendees receive their passes promptly and securely.
                                        Pass Scanning and Verification:
                                        
                                        The website includes a functionality for scanning passes. Attendees can have their QR code-based passes scanned directly from their mobile devices, streamlining the entry process. This scanning system is integrated into the website for ease of access and use during the event.
                                        Use Case and Scalability:
                                        
                                        The system was successfully deployed for all events hosted last year at LD College of Engineering, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability. Its ability to handle large numbers of attendees and multiple events simultaneously showcases its robustness.
                                        Technology Stack:
                                        
                                        The system is built using Django, which provides a solid and flexible backend framework.
                                        Ajax is used for asynchronous data communication, enhancing the responsiveness of the web application.
                                        Sockets are implemented for real-time communication, crucial for instant pass verification and data updates.
                                        WebRTC is utilized for the pass scanning feature, enabling real-time video capture for QR code scanning directly from the website.
                                        This event pass system represents a significant advancement in managing and conducting large-scale events. Its integration of QR codes, custom pass design, and efficient distribution and verification mechanisms make it a versatile and user-friendly solution. The successful implementation at a university level underscores its potential for broader applications in various event management scenarios. </p>
